# Deploy React App to GitHub Pages

At this point in the course, you have spent some time immersed in React and have even created some React apps of your own. React can seem confusing at first, but the good news is that `create-react-app` gives you the tools to build applications from scratch. This guide will show you how to deploy your React app to GitHub Pages while preserving the file structure of your source files.

Here are a few details to prepare you for this activity:

- The script you'll use is outlined in the `package.json` file for the React app. You will see it listed under the `scripts` section of the `package.json` for the `build` key-value pair.

- This command will output to a `/build` directory. This includes a `/build/static` directory that will contain all the required JavaScript and CSS files.

- Every file in this folder contains a unique hash of the file contents. The hash tells the browser how to download a fresh copy of the application every time you build it.

Now that we understand a little bit about what this command will do, let's put it into action and get the React app ready for GitHub Pages!
